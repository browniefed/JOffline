#JOffline
============

This is an offline Jama. It utilizes the REST API if you have it enabled to allow you to copy the work you need offline to work on the go.
You can then sync later and manage any conflicts with the current online version.

The is an unofficial application and is NOT supported by Jama in any way!


To get it working clone the repo then run these commands

```

npm install
grunt

```

This will create a build directory. Then select the platform that you are running on and run it.
Fill in your username, password, and Jama URL and everything else is handled by the application.

Windows, Mac, and Linux are all supported platforms.
